| ![Image 1](Documentation/bug1a.png)  |   | ![Image 1](Documentation/fix1a.png)  | Quiz didnÂ´t start because I used for start quiz input submit. The bug was fixed once I change it to button. |
| ![Image 1](Documentation/bug1b.png)  | ![Image 1](Documentation/screen1b.png)  | ![Image 1](Documentation/fix1b.png)   | Submit button was not showing alert message when clicking on it and instead the number on progress section was increasing. Bug solved with if !submitted. |
